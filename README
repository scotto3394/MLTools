Machine Learning Tools (MLTools)
Version: N/A
Author: Scott Manifold (scotto3394)


Language: Python 2.7 (with some Python 3.5 support that needs to be tested further)

Summary:
This is a personal toolkit built for me to prep, analyze, and work with unfamiliar data. The long term goal is to have a personal library of tools that will handle almost any (small scale) analysis of data, from prepping to presentation.

Note: Current functionality is quite lacking and not particularly usable.

Files:
- readingLib.py: Basic module for importing, extracting, and loading data (small scale ETL).
- plottingLib.py: Basic module for visualizing data. 
- timeLib.py: Basic module for working with Time Series data.
